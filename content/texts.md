This is largely an archive and curated reading list—as I do not intend to commit copyright infringement. 

All downloadable texts are within the [public domain](https://www.gutenberg.org/help/faq.html) and legitimate under intellectual protection clauses for personal consumption. 

*To my dismay, my preferred copies and translations may not be used.*

__DISCLAIMER:__ *Included authors may be somewhat controversial.*

{{< small >}}If you are uninterested in engaging with these texts critically—please leave my site.{{</ small >}} 

**NOTE**: *This is still largely unfinished; I will update my curation in my (limited) leisure*.

**TODO**: *Finish remaining sections (~ 1/5th complete)*.
