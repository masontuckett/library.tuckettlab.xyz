# About

**Per the request of some close friends:** 

I created this website as a way of offering a comprehensive reading list, primarily the Western canon, with more modern sensibilites. 

Although I do believe in the presupposition of objective value (high culture)—I find many authors, whom I heavily disagree with, to provide invaluable points of view.

My worldview is significantly influenced by my traditional Catholic leanings—wherein I'm quite sure the same criticism may be levied against my literary choices.

As of recent, I was already in the process of digitizing much of my physical library—so I found this to be a far more appropriate way of sharing material with others. 

Unfortunately, many of my books are not available within the public domain, so begrudgingly, I had to utilize subpar editions and translations.

{{< small >}}Texts that were not available will still be listed; although, for those available, I'd still search for the "correct" translations.{{</ small >}}

For the foreseeable future, I will be working on this site when I have enough free time; sadly, I have very few hours of leisure. 

{{< small >}}It may take a few weeks or even months to digitize everything necessary.{{</ small >}}
